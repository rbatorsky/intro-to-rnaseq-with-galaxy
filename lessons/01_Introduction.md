Information on Tufts Galaxy can be found [here](https://it.tufts.edu/research-technology/bioinformatics/tufts-galaxy).

Our dataset is from the publication:

Chang et al. **Next-Generation Sequencing Reveals HIV-1-Mediated Suppression of T Cell Activation and RNA Processing and Regulation of Noncoding RNA Expression in a CD4+T Cell Line.** mBio 2011doi: 10.1128/mBio.00134-11

The raw reads have been downsampled to 1 million reads per file in order to speed up computation.The full dataset is available from NCBI under accession [SRP013224](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP013224).

The following steps will walk you through how to run the tools. In each step certain parameters are set. If a parameter option appears on the screen but there is no mention of how to set it, leave it at the default.There are questions throughout, which serve to guide you through the results and check your understanding.
